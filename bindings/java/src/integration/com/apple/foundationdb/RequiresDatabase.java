/**
 * Rule to make it easy to write integration tests that only work when a running
 * database is detected and connectable using the default cluster file. Use this
 * as a @ClassRule on any integration test that requires a running database.
 *
 * This will attempt to connect to an FDB instance and perform a basic
 * operation. If it can do so quickly, then it will go ahead and run the
 * underlying test statement. If it cannot perform a basic operation against the
 * running DB, then it will throw an error and fail all tests
 *
 * There is a second safety valve--you can also set the env variable
 * `run.integration.tests` to false. If it's set, then all tests will just be
 * skipped outright, without trying to connect. This is useful for when you know you won't
 * be running a server and you don't want to deal with spurious test failures.
