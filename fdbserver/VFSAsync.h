    // The functions setInjectedError() and checkInjectedError() use an INetwork global to store the last
    // return code from VFSAsyncFile method resulting from catching an injected Error exception.  This allows
    // callers of the SQLite API to determine if an error code returned appears to be due to an injected
    // error in simulation.
    //
    // This scheme is not perfect, as it is possible for non-injected errors to occur after injected errors
    // and be incorrectly recognized as injected.  This problem already existed, however, as the previous scheme
    // assumed that any SQLite error that occurred after any injected error in the simulated process was
    // itself injected.
    //
    // Unfortunately, there is no easy or reliable way to plumb the injectedness of an error though the return
    // path of VFSAsyncFile -> SQLite -> SQLite API calls made by KeyValueStoreSQLite.
    //
    // An attempt was made to store injected errors in VFSAsyncFile instances and expose a SQLiteDB's file
    // instances via the SQLite API.  This failed, however, because sometimes files are opened, encounter an
    // error, and are closed within the lifetime of one SQLite API call so the caller never has an opportunity
    // to access the VFSAsyncFile object or its injected error state.
    //
    // An attempt was also made to match SQLite API return codes to VFSAsyncFile injected error return codes on 
    // a 1:1 basis, only flagging a code as rejected if it matches the last injected error code and only once.
    // This would have been more accurate (though coincidences could occur).  This scheme also failed, however,
    // because sometimes errors from SQLite APIs are temporarily ignored, relying on a subsequent API call to error,
    // however this error could be different and would not have been produced directly by VFSAsyncFile.
